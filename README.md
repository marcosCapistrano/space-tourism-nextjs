# Space Tourism: A collaboration between Frontend Mentor, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell

This project is a collaboration between [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com), and [Kevin Powell](https://youtube.com/kevinpowell).

[The project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub/space-tourism-multipage-website-olPVU7RrY) was created by Frontend Mentor, with [the course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) being taught by Kevin, and hosted on the interactive platform Scrimba.

# Ported to NextJS

The original course is written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. This one has been ported to NextJS for practice.

# NextJS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
